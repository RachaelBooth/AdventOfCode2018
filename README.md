## Advent of Code

My setup and (eventually) solutions to Advent of Code 2018. 

This is mostly a set of quick-to-write solutions, with no particular effort put in for readability, cleanliness, or optimization.

For my own benefit:

Run with:

```npm run solve -- -d <day> -p <part>```

Add files for new day with:

```npm run setup -- -d <day>```

Add ```-2``` to the above to copy file for part 2.


...I totally copied this set up from my one last year, although I'll change some things that were annoying as I go.
